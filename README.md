# PONGPONGPONG
An entirey homemade and highly incomplete classical mechanics simulator. For the time being I'm only keeping this here as a backup.
## To-do list
- [ ] A function that draws spheres, with illumination and appropriate perspective, so as to replace less efficient icospheres
- [ ] A more versatile interface for describing motion as well position integration
- [ ] A more versatile interface for collision detection
- [ ] Variable friction and elasticity
- [ ] Collision between arbitrary rigid bodies
- [ ] Force fields
- [ ] A `Renderer` that writes video files

I will be adding these features as time comes.
